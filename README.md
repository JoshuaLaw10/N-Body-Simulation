# N-Body-Simulation
This project simulates the N-body problem, a classical physics scenario where multiple bodies interact under gravitational forces. Using Python, the simulation calculates pairwise forces, updates positions and velocities over discrete time steps, and visualizes the resulting trajectories. Ideal for educational purposes and complex modelling.
