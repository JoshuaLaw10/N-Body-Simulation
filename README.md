# N-Body Simulation

This project simulates the **N-body problem**, a foundational concept in classical mechanics where multiple bodies interact under gravity. Built with **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, this simulation evolves gravitational systems over time and visualizes orbital trajectories with rich customization options.

## 🚀 What Makes This Project Special

It goes beyond basic simulation, supporting a wide range of scenarios from theoretical models to real solar system dynamics:

## 🌌 Featured N-Body Scenarios

- ☀️ **Solar System Subset (Sun + Planets)**  
  Simulate gravitational motion of inner solar system bodies such as the Sun, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. Observe how planetary masses and distances result in stable elliptical orbits or chaotic perturbations.

- 🚀 **Voyager 1 + Solar System Simulation**  
  Model Voyager 1’s flyby trajectory in a gravitational field defined by major planets (e.g., Jupiter, Saturn). Uses initial positions from NASA ephemeris data to visualize the real influence of solar system bodies on deep space missions.

- 🌍🌕☀️ **Sun–Earth–Moon System**  
  A foundational three-body setup showing how the Moon orbits Earth while both orbit the Sun. Demonstrates barycenter dynamics and tidal-like gravitational complexity.

- 🔺 **General Three- and Four-Body Problems**  
  Observe how adding bodies leads to emergent chaotic behavior. Three-body systems already show unpredictability, and four-body simulations often result in symmetry-breaking or escape events.

- 🌀 **Stable vs. Unstable Three-Body Systems**  
  - 🔒 **Stable Setup**: Three equal-mass bodies placed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with carefully tuned tangential velocities can orbit their common center in a repeating, balanced configuration.  
  - 🔄 **Quasi-Stable Setup**: Slight deviations in mass or velocity may persist temporarily but ultimately spiral into instability — illustrating sensitivity to initial conditions.  
  - 💥 **Unstable Setup**: Random placements and velocities typically lead to chaotic motion, with collisions or ejections as energy redistributes across the system.

- ⚖️ **Euler vs RK45 Integration**  
  Easily switch between integration methods to see how numerical accuracy affects energy conservation, orbit shape, and long-term behavior.

- 🔋 **Energy Conservation Checking**  
  Monitor total system energy (kinetic + potential) to validate the simulation’s physical fidelity, especially under long runtimes or coarse time steps.

What began as a coding experiment quickly turned into something unexpectedly satisfying. Watching the simulations come to life and seeing how a few lines of math and physics could mimic the vast motions of the universe was genuinely rewarding.
